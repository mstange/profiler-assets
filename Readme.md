# profiler-assets

This is a temporary place to store assets for the profiler, most importantly WASM modules, which Firefox can download on demand when the profiler is used.

This work to make use of these assets in Firefox is happening in [bug 1509549](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1509549).
